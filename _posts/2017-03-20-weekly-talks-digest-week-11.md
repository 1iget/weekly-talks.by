# Meetup

Meetup on _a typical React project_ was big. It attracted more than 70
developers, which means a lot of new faces and connections, previous JavaScript
meetups attracted up to 30-40 persons.

[Pavel Zubkou][] showed that JavaScript fatigue passed away long time ago.
Combination of tools from a React ecosystem and a simple workflow makes magic
a reality.

Plain `create-react-app`, Storybook, Jest, Flow and Storyshots glued together
in an easy way is a perfect match which bring developer experience to a new
heights.

[Zmicier Jarasevic][] played devil's advocate, and showed internals of
`create-react-app` raising a few questions to warm up attendees ;) What for?
Everyone should `eject` react-script at least once in a life, out of
curiosity or for learning a few things.
